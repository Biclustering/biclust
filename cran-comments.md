## Submission Notes

* Update to 2.0.0: fix NOTES + addition BC interaction testing functions

* There is a remaining note about "Found no calls to: 'R_registerRoutines', 'R_useDynamicSymbols'"

An attempt was done to get rid of this NOTE by carrying out the following actions:
- Add registration to the NAMESPACE: useDynLib(biclust, .registration=TRUE)
- Add a biclust_init.c to the src folder which was generated by tools::package_native_routine_registration_skeleton()

However these actions did not get rid of the note. Would you have any further suggestions to remove this NOTE?

Thank you in advance for your time and help.
