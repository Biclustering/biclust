\title{
Diagnostic F Statistic Calculation
}
\description{
Functions for obtaining F statistics within bicluster and the significance levels. The main effects considered are row, column and interaction effect.
}
\usage{
computeObservedFstat(x, bicResult, number)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
Data Matrix

}
  \item{bicResult}{
 \code{Biclust} object from \code{biclust} package
}
  \item{number}{
Number of bicluster in the output for computing observed statistics 
}
}
\details{
F-statistics are calculated from the two-way ANOVA mode with row anc column effect. The full model with interaction is undentifiable, thus, Tukey's test for non-additivity is used to detect an  interaction within a bicluster. 
p-values are obtained from assymptotic F distributions.
}
\value{
Data frame with three rows ("Row Effect", "Column Effect", "Tukey test") and 2 columns for corresponding statistics (Fstat) and their p-values (PValue).
